###Growth

Paul Graham [said](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) that a startup is a company designed to grow fast. Growth distinguishes startups from the millions of local service businesses launched every year. If a startup adds a fixed number new users per week, the user count will scale linearly. Over time, the ratio of new users added per week approaches one. Startups want growth that is proportional to their current size. A fixed percentage of new users added per week leads to a non-linear explosion in total user count (red, below).

###Why is growth important?

Consider two companies growing with a two-fold difference in rate. After one year, the first startup has passed the knee of its exponential and the difference in revenue is more than 10-fold. Many iconic startups have enjoyed this run-away growth due to a network effect. Consider OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation marketplace. As more restaurants entered the system, more diners followed. This attracted more restaurants, fueling a flywheel that has given OpenTable over [90% market share](http://www.gourmetmarketing.net/rezbook-review-new-opentable-competitor/).

###Growth parameters

***Market*** 

Growth eventually runs up against bounds. Consider Facebook’s impressive user growth, with [data pulled from Ben Foster's blog](http://www.benphoster.com/facebook-user-growth-chart-2004-2010/). A trivial upper-bound for Facebook’s growth is the population of the world. But, it’s more interesting to consider psychological bounds. As explained by [Alex Schultz](http://genius.com/Alex-schultz-lecture-6-growth-annotated), Facebook hit a wall ~50M users (dashed line).

At the time, no social network had suppressed 100M users and some doubted whether it was possible. Of course, they did it. Chamath has a good [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raIUQP71SBU) about what it took to get past this barrier. The point is that growth bounds exist, but they are not always obvious to identify (more on that later).

***Acquisition*** 

A fundamental feature of fast growth is feedback. The number of new users added is ideally proportional to the number of existing users. Viral marketing math captures feedback in a series of specific steps, [a viral loop](http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/lessons-learnt-viral-marketing/), that link existing users to new user acquisition. This model can explain the hyper-growth observed for some startups. 

For example, Peter Theil [explained](http://blakemasters.com/post/22405055017/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-9-notes-essay) that Paypal had growth of 7% daily at one point. This growth began with power sellers and buyers who executed many transactions per unit time. Through cash incentives, Paypal had a high conversion rate. Many who were exposed to the product through power users joined.   

***Retention*** 

It's interesting to see that acquisition and retention are independent parameters in the growth model. [Alex Schultz](http://genius.com/Alex-schultz-lecture-6-growth-annotated) explains how retention curves are useful for modeling this. A retention curve captures the degradation rate in monthly user activity following acquisition. In the worst cast, it flattens out to zero. No users remain after some period of time.

I simulated a few scenarios to convince myself. Here's a link to the iPython notebook. At best, growth is stifled when users churn. At worst, growth crashes out to zero. Of course, it depends upon the assumptions for growth and degradation rate. Nevertheless, the intuition is pretty clear. Leaky buckets don’t need water. They need to be patched. Viral acquisition with a bad product will hemorrhage users.  

###Product

It's intreating to consider what underpin these parameters. There's probably a lot of answers to this question. But it seems clear that product is central. Facebook and Uber grew via work of mouth because the products were so good. Unlike Hotmail or Dropbox, there was [no native way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raIUQP71SBU) to contact people from within the app.

In some cases, the market size is a function of product quality. This point is lost in typical projections of total available market using historical data. A recent debate between Bill Gurley and Aswath Damodaran about [Uber](http://abovethecrowd.com/2014/07/11/how-to-miss-by-a-mile-an-alternative-look-at-ubers-potential-market-size/) highlights this: in 2012, Uber was 100% of the total historical black car market in San Francisco. It is now several-fold larger.

Similarly, viral user acquisition is [intrinsic to design](http://blakemasters.com/post/22405055017/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-9-notes-essay) of the product. Dropbox and Spotify provide native ways to contact users outside of the applications. Ed Baker, head of growth at Uber, developed a [few products](http://michaelrucker.com/thought-leader-interviews/edward-baker-the-viral-factor/) designed for specifically for viral user acquisition. 

###The case for product science

Jeff Jordan has a blog post [explaining](http://jeff.a16z.com/2012/01/18/a-recipe-for-growth-adding-layers-to-the-cake/) the two ways that product innovation combats what he calls “gravity," the inevitable depression of startup growth rate. Simply, a startup can optimize existing products or it can develop new ones. This is pretty obvious. But it's interesting to drill down on each one.

####Improving the existing product
 
***User heterogeneity*** 

[Alex Schultz](http://genius.com/Alex-schultz-lecture-6-growth-annotated) made a point that initiated my interested in this: growth requires looking not at the power users, but rather at the marginal users. Users are a mixed pool. Some are about to churn off your app. The likelihood of a user to churn may be a function of obvious features (e.g., freind count). Usually one of these features matters most.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/user_equ.png" width="100%">

</figure>

For Facebook growth, it was friend count: they focused on getting people to 10 friends in 14 days. Josh Elman, product lead for growth Twitter, explained that they focused on visits. If a user visited Twitter at least [7 times in a month](https://medium.com/@joshelman/the-only-metric-that-matters-ab24a585b5ea), then it was likely you were going to be visiting Twitter in the next month.

How to identify the feature that distinguishes users? It's probably intuitive in many cases. In others, simple classification methods could probably be useful. In any case, it's pretty clear that the best growth and product teams keenly understand this. There's a clear feature that partitions users and this can guide experimental design (e.g., A/B testing) for product improvement.

***Market heterogeneity***

But, different markets can complicate this. Chamath [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raIUQP71SBU) about Facebook's international growth and need for localization of the app to specific markets. Similarly, consider marketplaces like AirBnB, Instacart, and Uber that are operating in hundreds of different cities or dozens of countries simultaneously.

Uber is in 150 cities and its gross revenue has more than doubled each year, for the past three years. This is impressive. But the more interesting point is their distribution of revenue: apparently the bulk comes from [only 10 cities](http://www.businessinsider.com/ubers-revenue-2014-11) today. There's a lot of headroom. City-specific features may be useful for driving growth in each one.

To aid this, cities are releasing their data. For example, I pulled all [311 requests](http://www.sf311.org/index.aspx?page=161) provided by `SF open data`. This contains 1.1 million service requests collected across ~900 categories. Each record is geo-tagged. I used the [`basemap`](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/) library in `python` to overlay reported `Pavement Defects` on a map of San Francisco. 

<figure>

</figure>

It is easy to capture features like road congestion or pavement defects that may affect marketplace businesses like Uber. At the same time, Uber has organized their own data into city-specific features. For example, demand patters from different neighborhoods [can be isolated](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2012/08/using-uber-ridership-data-compare-cities-and-neighborhoods/2890/). Collectively, this means that each city or neighborhood can be understood as a set of granular features.

What can be done once your different markets can be organized:

* *** Benchmarking **** Neighborhoods or cities can be grouped based upon similar features. Comparing mature to nascent markets within the same group can provides insight for growth. 

<figure>
<img src="/assets/city_compare.png" width="100%">

</figure>

* *** Understanding growth **** Before, we considered simple cases: friend count or page visits provides predictive information about whether a user will churn. Similarly, we may expect price or ETA to be universal indicators of churn for consumers on Uber. But what about drivers, which are equally important in the two-sided marketplace. Capturing a broader set of market-specific features could be used to examine whether geographical considerations explain the observed variation user or driver metrics.

####Making new products 

That was all related to product optimization, for which a lot of data exists. The other dimention for growth is diversification outside of the core business. Jeff Jordan [calls this](http://jeff.a16z.com/2012/01/18/a-recipe-for-growth-adding-layers-to-the-cake/) "adding layers to the cake.” Unlike optimization, data typically does not exist for this. 

Good products tap into something buried within the human psyche, but also have very low cognitive overhead. Traditional tools of product science (e.g., surveys, ad campaigns, email marketing, focus groups) may fail to capture this and projecting growth into Greenfield markets is [famously inaccurate](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~alozano/innovation/).

An alternative, hypothesis-driven approach has been largely institutionalized in the lean startup movement. While this has been adopted by startups searching for a business model, Steve Blank points out that this could also be relevant for [large corporations](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything) expanding their business scope.

With this in mind, a lot has been said about [the full-stack startup](http://a16z.com/2015/01/22/the-full-stack-startup/). Lyft and Uber are examples of this. They re-built the whole service using modern software. I think one of most interesting outcomes is that companies like this are large-scale experimental machines, a giant lab that interfaces with the physical world.

Based upon their blog, Uber has rolled seeral dozen different products, including on-demand [flu shots](http://blog.uber.com/health), [weddings](http://blog.uber.com/uberwedding), and [logistics](http://blog.uber.com/RUSH). Each one is an experiment. Once a digital grid is build, it becomes a pretty significant platform on which you can run experiments and obtain data that no one else can

###Summary

Startups are companies designed to grow. Fast growth means that startups can overtake finite markets quickly. Growth is driven by market size as well as user acquisition and retention. Product is central for all of these. If product is the lever that controls growth, then the question is how to alter product in order to drive it. 

One way is to improve the existing product. All startups are have distribution of user behavior; some users are active and others are soon to churn off the app. The best companies have identified product features that explain this variance in user behavior. Once these features are identified, product improvements can be centered around them. 

The other way is to develop new products. This requires experimentation. One of the most interesting features of full-stack startups is that they are massive experimentation engines. They can run experiments that no one else can and use this to gain insight into the next generation of product.
