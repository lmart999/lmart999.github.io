###Growth

Paul Graham [said](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) that a startup is a company designed to grow fast. Growth distinguishes startups from the millions of local service businesses launched every year. If a startup adds a fixed number new users per week, the user count will scale linearly. Over time, the ratio of new users added per week approaches one. Startups want growth that is proportional to their current size. A fixed percentage of new users added per week leads to a non-linear explosion in total user count (red, below).

###Why is growth important?

Consider two companies growing with a two-fold difference in rate. After one year, the first startup has passed the knee of its exponential and the difference in revenue is more than 10-fold. Many iconic startups have enjoyed this run-away growth due to a network effect. Consider OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation marketplace. As more restaurants entered the system, more diners followed. This attracted more restaurants, fueling a flywheel that has given OpenTable over [90% market share](http://www.gourmetmarketing.net/rezbook-review-new-opentable-competitor/).

###Growth parameters

***Market size*** 

Growth runs up against bounds. Consider Facebook’s growth ([data from Ben Foster's blog](http://www.benphoster.com/facebook-user-growth-chart-2004-2010/)). A trivial upper-bound is the world population. But, it’s more interesting to consider psychological bounds. As explained by [Alex Schultz](http://genius.com/Alex-schultz-lecture-6-growth-annotated), Facebook hit a wall ~50M users (dashed line).

At the time, no social network had surpassed 100M users. Some doubted whether it was possible. Of course, they did it. Chamath has a good [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raIUQP71SBU) about what it took to get past this barrier. The point is that growth bounds exist, but they are not always obvious to identify (more on that later).

***Acquisition*** 

Feedback is critical for fast growth: the number of new users should be proportional to the existing user base. Viral marketing math captures this feedback in a [loop](http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/lessons-learnt-viral-marketing/) that links existing users to new user acquisition. The viral loop can explain the hyper-growth observed for some startups. 

For example, Peter Theil [noted](http://blakemasters.com/post/22405055017/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-9-notes-essay) that Paypal had 7% daily growth at one point. This growth loop began with power sellers and buyers who executed many transactions per unit time. With cash incentives, Paypal also had a high conversion rate among those exposed to the product through power users.   

***Retention*** 

Acquisition and retention are independent parameters in the growth model. This is key. [Alex Schultz](http://genius.com/Alex-schultz-lecture-6-growth-annotated) explains how retention curves are used for modeling this. A retention curve captures the degradation rate in monthly active users following acquisition. In the worst cast, it flattens out to zero.

I simulated a few scenarios to convince myself (link to iPython notebook). At best, growth is stifled when users churn. At worst, growth crashes out to zero. The intuition is pretty clear. Leaky buckets don’t need water. They need to be patched. Viral acquisition with a bad product will hemorrhage users.  

###Product and growth

Product underpins all three growth parameters. Facebook grew through work of mouth because the product was so good. Unlike Hotmail, there was [no native way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raIUQP71SBU) to pull-in non-users from the app.

Uber has shown that market size can be function of product quality. A debate between Bill Gurley and Aswath Damodaran [highlights this](http://abovethecrowd.com/2014/07/11/how-to-miss-by-a-mile-an-alternative-look-at-ubers-potential-market-size/): in 2012, Uber was ~100% of the total historical black car market in San Francisco. With product and very low prices, it continue to expand the market for ride-sharing.

Viral user acquisition is also [intrinsic to product design](http://blakemasters.com/post/22405055017/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-9-notes-essay). Dropbox and Hotmail provided native ways to draw new users into the app. Ed Baker, head of growth at Uber, has developed a [few products](http://michaelrucker.com/thought-leader-interviews/edward-baker-the-viral-factor/) on email, SMS, IM, and Facebook designed specifically for viral growth.

###The case for product science

If product is a key lever that controls growth, then how to make product decisions to promote growth? Simply, product innovation can optimize the existing product or develop new ones.

####Optimize the existing product
 
***User heterogeneity*** 

[Alex Schultz](http://genius.com/Alex-schultz-lecture-6-growth-annotated) made a key point here. There is a distribution of users. Some are about to churn off your app. With the retention curve in mind, it is important to identify product features that influence churn.

</figure>

Identifying the features that classify the likelihood of churn appears to have some black magic. It's intuitive in some cases. In other situations, learning (classification) methods could probably be used. 

But, the best growth and product teams seem to understand and boil this down. For Facebook, it was friend count. Zuck talks about getting people to 10 friends in 14 days. Josh Elman, product lead for growth at Twitter, explained that they focused on visits, with [7 times per month](https://medium.com/@joshelman/the-only-metric-that-matters-ab24a585b5ea) the critical threshold.

If there is product feature that strongly partitions users based upon a key metric, like churn, then experiments (e.g., A/B testing) for product improvement can be centered around this insight.

***Market heterogeneity***

Different markets can complicate this. Chamath [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raIUQP71SBU) about Facebook's international growth and need for localization of the app to specific markets. Uber is doing this now in 150 cities and 46 counties. 

Gross revenue has more than doubled for the past three years. This is impressive, but their distribution of revenue is also interesting: apparently the bulk comes from [~ 10 cities](http://www.businessinsider.com/ubers-revenue-2014-11). There's a lot of headroom. 

But, this also shows that the business has high heterogeneity due to specific demographic or structural features for each city. To get a handle on this, high-resolution city data is sometimes available. 

For example, I pulled all [311 requests](http://www.sf311.org/index.aspx?page=161) provided by `SF open data`. This contains 1.1 million service requests that are geo-tagged. I used the [`basemap`](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/) library in `python` to overlay reported `Pavement Defects` on a map of San Francisco, showing a heatmap per neighborhood.

Along with available city data, Uber has organized their own data into city- and neighborhood-specific features (below). For example, neighborhoods have [unique demand patterns](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2012/08/using-uber-ridership-data-compare-cities-and-neighborhoods/2890/). This means that each city and neighborhood can be understood as a potentially broad set of granular features.

These features provide a handle for organizing and comparing the diverse set of cities.

* ***Comparative analysis*** Neighborhoods or cities can be grouped based upon similar features. Grouping can identify outliers, where to expand next based upon similarity to prior successes, and it may identify ways to apply insights gained in one market to others.

* ***Localizing growth strategy*** I wonder how much market-specific features explain the variance in key (user or driver) metrics, like acquisition or churn. It's pretty clear that price or ETA are universally important. But, including a broader set of market-specific features may reveal insights for growth and product beyond what appears to be universally obvious. 

####Develop new products

For product optimization, lots of data exists. The other dimension for growth is diversification outside of the core business. Jeff Jordan [calls this](http://jeff.a16z.com/2012/01/18/a-recipe-for-growth-adding-layers-to-the-cake/) "adding layers to the cake.” Unlike optimization, data typically does not exist for this. Good products tap deep into the human psyche are [hard to predict](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~alozano/innovation/).

Hypothesis-driven product development has been adopted by many startups searching for a business model, though Steve Blank points out that this is also be relevant for [large corporations](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything). I think this is where [full-stack startups](http://a16z.com/2015/01/22/the-full-stack-startup/). These companies re-built the service stack using modern software.

Because they own the stack, they can extend it in new ways. This makes them large-scale experimental machines, capable of testing ideas and generating data that no one else can. Based upon their blog, Uber has rolled several dozen different products at pilot-scale, including on-demand [flu shots](http://blog.uber.com/health), [weddings](http://blog.uber.com/uberwedding), and [logistics](http://blog.uber.com/RUSH). Once a digital grid is build, it becomes a pretty significant platform on which you can run experiments that tests ideas for the next iteration of on-demand products. 

###Summary

Startups are companies designed to grow. Product is central for growth. Given that product is the lever that controls growth, then the question is how to alter product in order to drive it. 

One way is to improve the existing product. The best companies identified product features that explain the variance in key user behaviors - such as churn - and target improvements around them. 

The other way is to develop new products. This requires experimentation. Full-stack startups are massive experimentation engines. Product insights can be gleaned from the resulting data.
