####Cell-free DNA

In 1947, Mandel and Metais first observed that human blood contains circulating cell-free DNA molecules. These fragments enter blood as the detritus of dead cells and circulate with short (15 minute) half-life as nucleosome-protected fragments. Methods of molecular counting, such as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, have taken advantage of this phenomenon. The abundance of cell-free DNA species may correlate with human health and numerous diagnostic tests have emerged to evaluate this.

Their greatest value has been to measure the proportion of foreign genomes within an individual. Cancer-associated mutations can be used to determine the progress of [cancer](http://www.genome.gov/27556716), fetal DNA assayed by molecular counting can be used to [detect aneuploidies](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/new-dna-test-better-at-predicting-some-disorders-in-babies-study-finds/?_r=0) such as Down syndrome, and donor-organ derived DNA fragments can be monitored as marker of rejection following [transplantation](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/caredx-presents-cell-free-dna-biomarker-results-in-heart-and-kidney-transplant-recipients-at-the-world-transplant-congress-2014-07-28).
