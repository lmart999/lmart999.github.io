####The cell-free DNA phenomenon

In 1947, Mandel and Metais first observed that human blood contains circulating cell-free DNA molecules. These fragments enter blood as the detritus of dead cells and circulate with short (15 minute) half-life before being degraded by enzymes. Recent technologies for molecular counting, such as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), can read these molecules at very high throughput. This has lead to a surge of data-centric and non-invasive diagnostic tests, which are all rooted in the observation that the abundance of particular cell-free DNA molecules correlates with human health.

The greatest value of these tests has been the ability to measure the proportion of foreign genomes within an individual. For example, cancer-associated mutations in cell-free DNA can be used to non-invasively monitor the progress of [cancer](http://www.genome.gov/27556716), fetal DNA assayed by molecular counting can be used to non-invasively [detect Down Syndrome](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/new-dna-test-better-at-predicting-some-disorders-in-babies-study-finds/?_r=0), and donor-organ derived DNA fragments can be monitored as a marker of rejection following [transplantation](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/caredx-presents-cell-free-dna-biomarker-results-in-heart-and-kidney-transplant-recipients-at-the-world-transplant-congress-2014-07-28). Much of my PhD was focused on extending this idea to new problems.

####Infectious diease and cell-free DNA

The ability to resolve foreign genomes in blood presents an opportunity for non-invasive infectious disease monitoring. Already, a [rising tide](http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/06/114946/faster-dna-sleuthing-saves-critically-ill-boy) of studies have made a strong case for NGS in infectious disease scenarios, such as resistance and outbreak monitoring. In parallel, [much work](http://www.hmpdacc.org/) has focused on using NGS as a tool to measure the human microbionme. We extended these studies by developing and validating a way to measure the infections or the human microbiome from blood.

Simply, this is a data problem, because the biochemistry and technology needed to isolate cell-free DNA and perform NGS are well worked out. 



ability to perform such measurments non-invasively from blood adds to the power of NGS, as blood presents a window into the microbiome of deep tissues that are otherwise inaccessible.

Genome fragments in human blood can be isolated and sequenced. The digitized genome fragments are simply strings of letters, which can be further filtered based upon similarity to known microbial sequencings. Strings that match to pathogens can be counted.
