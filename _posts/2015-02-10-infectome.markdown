####The cell-free DNA phenomenon

In 1947, Mandel and Metais first observed that human blood contains circulating cell-free DNA molecules. These fragments enter blood as the detritus of dead cells and circulate with short (15 minute) half-life before being degraded by enzymes. Recent technologies for molecular counting, such as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), can read these molecules at very high throughput. This has lead to a surge of data-centric and non-invasive diagnostic tests, which are all rooted in the observation that the abundance of particular cell-free DNA molecules correlates with human health.

The greatest value of these tests has been the ability to measure the proportion of foreign genomes within an individual. For example, cancer-associated mutations in cell-free DNA can be used to non-invasively monitor the progress of [cancer](http://www.genome.gov/27556716), fetal DNA assayed by molecular counting can be used to non-invasively [detect Down syndrom](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/new-dna-test-better-at-predicting-some-disorders-in-babies-study-finds/?_r=0), and donor-organ derived DNA fragments can be monitored as a marker of rejection following [transplantation](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/caredx-presents-cell-free-dna-biomarker-results-in-heart-and-kidney-transplant-recipients-at-the-world-transplant-congress-2014-07-28).

####Infectious diease and cell-free DNA

The ability to resolve foreign genomes in blood presents an opportunity for infectious disease monitoring. Already, a [rising tide](http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/06/114946/faster-dna-sleuthing-saves-critically-ill-boy) of studies have made a strong case for NGS in various infectious disease scearios, such as resistance and outbreak monitoring. The ability to perform such measurments non-invasively from blood adds to the power of NGS, as blood presents a window into the microbiome of deep tissues that are otherwise inaccessible.
