####Basics!

It's very easy to make some words **bold**.

And to make other words *italic* with Markdown. 

You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com).

#### Bullet points work!

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

#### Tables work!

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

####Images work!

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/cancer_1.jpg" width="70%">
<div class="thecap">The O.G.</a>.</div>
</div>

#### Code

Test `time.sleep`

```python
import codecs
codecs.open(filename, 'w', 'utf-8').write(tweet_texts)
```
