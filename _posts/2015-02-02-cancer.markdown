# Basics!

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. 

You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# Bullet points work!

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

# Tables work!

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

# Images work!

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/cancer_1.jpg">
<div class="thecap">The O.G.</a>.</div>
</div>

# Strike through

like ~~this~~

# Code

{% highlight javascript %}
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
{% endhighlight %}
